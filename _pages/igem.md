A key way of sustaining scientific research and innovation is to nurture and encourage the curiosity of a younger generation of students and research trainees. The [International Genetic Engineering Machine (iGEM)](https://competition.igem.org/) competition is an excellent introduction to Synthetic Biology research for young students, and I have been participating in it in different capacities since 2013.
