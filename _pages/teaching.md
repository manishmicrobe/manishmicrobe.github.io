I teach the following courses at the University of Paris-Saclay and AgroParisTech:

* 2017−now: UE1.2: Biological Parts and Devices [ECTS 3.5], [Master’s in Systems and Synthetic Biology (mSSB)](https://www.mssb.fr/), University of Paris-Saclay. (co-taught with Cyrille Pauthenier)

* 2019−2022: Synthetic Biology lecture series, AgroParisTech.


### Teaching materials

* mSSB (2024)

Since I started teaching this course in 2017, I have updated it regularly to include relevant examples from synthetic biology literature (non-exhaustive). 

I post the most recent slides below in the hope that others will find them useful. 

* Lecture-1: [What is Synthetic Biology?](/assets/pdf/Lecture-1_2024_mSSB_UE2.1_Synbio_Intro.pdf)
* Lecture-3a: [Molecular Cloning for Biological Expression Design](/assets/pdf/Lecture-3a_2024_mSSB_UE2.1_Molecular_Cloning.pdf)
* Lecture-3b: [Sequence Editing Exercise](/assets/pdf/Lecture-3b_2024_mSSB_UE2.1_Sequence_Editing.pdf)
* Lecture-4: [Synthetic Circuits in Prokaryotes](/assets/pdf/Lecture-4_2024_mSSB_UE2.1_Prokaryotic_Circuits.pdf)
* Lecture-5: [Synthetic Circuits in Eukaryotes](/assets/pdf/Lecture-5_2024_mSSB_UE2.1_Eukaryotic_Circuits.pdf)
* Lecture-6: [Debugging and Modelling of Genetic Circuits](/assets/pdf/Lecture-6_2024_mSSB_UE2.1_Debugging_&_Modelling.pdf)
